Tomato cultivation faces significant challenges due to various leaf diseases, 
leading to substantial yield losses. Globally, around 186 million tons of tomatoes are 
produced annually, yet 20â€“25% of the yield is lost to leaf-related diseases, with severe 
cases causing up to 90% losses. Early detection and accurate classification are essential 
for mitigating these impacts and ensuring food security. The system presents an 
advanced tomato leaf disease detection and classification using CNN (Convolutional 
Neural Networks). Deep learning models, particularly pretrained architectures like 
VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group 16) and InceptionV3, are employed for feature 
extraction and classification. VGG16, known for its efficiency in handling smaller 
datasets, captures fine-grained leaf features crucial for detecting subtle disease 
symptoms. In contrast, InceptionV3 processes images at multiple scales, effectively 
recognizing complex patterns in leaf texture and disease variations. The proposed 
system categorizes tomato leaves into three classes: Healthy, Resistant, and Infected. 
This classification not only aids in early diagnosis but also helps monitor disease 
progression, enabling farmers to take timely preventive measures. By leveraging deep 
learning for precise disease identification, this approach enhances crop health 
management, reduces economic losses, and supports sustainable agriculture.
